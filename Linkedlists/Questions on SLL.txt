1. What is the difference between an array and a linked list?

    Array: Fixed size, random access (O(1)), costly insertion/deletion.

    Linked List: Dynamic size, sequential access (O(n)), efficient insertion/deletion.

2. What is the time complexity of insertion and deletion in a linked list?

    At head â†’ O(1)

    At end â†’ O(n) (unless tail pointer is maintained)

    Search â†’ O(n)

3. How do you detect a cycle in a linked list?

    Use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise & Hare).

4. Why linked lists are preferred over arrays in some cases?
